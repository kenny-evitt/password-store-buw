======================

This is a 'soft fork' for adding clipboard support in Bash on Ubuntu on
Windows. This repo should otherwise track the upstream repo exactly and is
only intended to persist until the relevant changes have been accepted and
merged into the upstream repo.

This is a very simple password store that encrypts passwords using gpg and
places the encrypted password in a directory. It can generate new passwords
and keep track of old ones.

Visit the project page for more information: http://www.passwordstore.org/

Please see the man page for documentation and examples.
